Sometimes you just need some helper functions to help us draw a chart, and render it using vanilla JS or frameworks like React, Vue, etc. Superchart provides helper functions to make a chart, and it is up to you how you would render the chart.

# Why?
- It is tiny (< 1KB).
- It doesn't force you to render chart with a specific way.
- Typescript-friendly (the library itself is written in Typescript).

# Installation
For now, Superchart can only be installed via npm by running the following command in your project:
```
npm i superchart
```

# Example
Coming soon.
